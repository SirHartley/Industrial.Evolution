#Entities,,,,,
IndEvo_JumpRift,CUSTOM,"A massive rip in the fabric of space leading to hyperspace. It was created by firing the Rift Generator, moving the planet that once stood here to a different star system.",,,
IndEvo_arsenalStation,CUSTOM,"An abandoned arsenal station, built to outlast whatever weapons a long dead enemy would have brought to bear. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
IndEvo_orbitalLaboratory,CUSTOM,"An abandoned orbital laboratory. Stations like this were built to keep experimental tech away from prying eyes. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
IndEvo_Watchtower,CUSTOM,"This automated remnant of old domain system defence transmits targetting data to nearby artillery. The encrypted target data is inaccessible to the controlling faction, and does not expose the actual position of the observed fleet.",,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation,CUSTOM,"A massive, domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.",,,

Old safety protocols prohibit targeting of inhabited areas.",,,
IndEvo_Artillery_missile,CUSTOM,"A massive, domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.

The defence platform is armed with a missile launcher, firing oversized long-range target seeking ECM missiles to interdict and slow hostiles.

Old safety protocols prohibit targeting of inhabited areas.",,,
IndEvo_Artillery_railgun,CUSTOM,"A massive, domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.

The defence platform is armed with a railgun, firing multiple extremely fast projectiles at an long range.

Old safety protocols prohibit targeting of inhabited areas.",,,
IndEvo_GachaStation,CUSTOM,"The silent rings of this massive autofactory loom in front of a violent star, heatshields blackened by stellar emissions. Pillars of machinery, almost gothic in their complicated shapes and decorations, show the reverence with which this old station was built and kept - which obviously did not save it from abandonment.",,,

IndEvo_base_refining,CUSTOM,"A specialized version of refining that can be reconfigured to deliver higher yields for specific commodities, at the cost of other output. Smelting plants here convert ores and transplutonic ores into metals and transplutonics, respectively. Teleoperated robotics are used to handle the most dangerous tasks, usually.",metals and transplutonics,,
IndEvo_ore_refining,CUSTOM,"Specialized smelting infrastructure to extract valuable metal from ore. Does not work with transplutonics or other rare ores, but reaches a higher extraction efficiency than normal smelting plants. Teleoperated robotics are used to handle the most dangerous tasks, usually.",metals,,
IndEvo_rare_refining,CUSTOM,"Specialized smelting infrastructure to extract rare transplutonics from the respective ore. Normal ore is not smelted here as the furnaces are specialized towards exotic ore applications with high efficiency. Teleoperated robotics are used to handle the most dangerous tasks, usually.",transplutonics,,
IndEvo_base_mining,CUSTOM,"Metal and metalloid ores, organics, and volatile compounds all require heavy equipment, special infrastructure, and a skilled workforce to extract. The harsh work attracts a certain type, and an administration that's not willing to look the other way now and again may find itself running short of willing personnel.","ore, transplutonic ore and volatiles",,

IndEvo_pop_uw,CUSTOM,"A cartel of ruthless criminal families rule this polity with an iron fist. Petty decisions are made by the local bosses on a whim, and individual fortune can change quicker than credsticks change hands in one of the countless gambling dens. Everything can be made possible by the ever-changing status quo.","Low stability increases income, all commodities are legal and have increased output.",,

#Commodities,,,,,
IndEvo_parts,RESOURCE,"Old starship parts which can no longer be properly produced by the decaying Sector infrastructure. Their only reliable source is the deconstruction of existing ships. A shortage of these will not prohibit the construction of new ships by much, but it will seriously affect their quality.",,,
IndEvo_rare_parts,RESOURCE,"Ancient or highly advanced technology which can no longer be manufactured in the Persean Sector. These components are essential to building new, pristine spaceships - they do not get traded on the open market, and are the reason Salvage Yards are usually viciously guarded.",,,

#Weapons,,,,,
IndEvo_cryoartillery,WEAPON,"""We were able to replicate the weapon's core from a molecular scan and it appears to be functional, though we remain clueless as to how it actually operates. While it might well violently implode at any moment, we managed to hook it up to a pair of accelerator rails for now, and initial tests show it to be working at just above 2/3 of the originals measured output.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Snowblind",,
IndEvo_degrader,WEAPON,"""While the weapon has proven functional, the actual performance fell well below anticipated levels. For some reason it refuses to draw sufficient power before discharge and the project lead decided to leave it at that after one of the techs got disintegrated trying to find the cause. The new plan is to scale down the frame to just what is needed to hit the apparent draw cap.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Spitfire",,
IndEvo_causalitygun,WEAPON,"""So, the cascading energy fluctuations that have been plaguing us all week appear to have fixed themselves without us doing anything. The power supply guys said they had planned to make some adjustments later today, so it wasn't them either. With how little we know about the components we're working with, it wouldn't surprise me if it's just some weird moon phases.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Eureka",,
IndEvo_pulsedcarbine,WEAPON,"""Considering the catastrophic side effects of capacitor charge processes near the core unit, we have decided to shift to an entirely different system of simply supplying new capacitor units to the weapon with ammo feeders. This seems to avert the issues entirely so far, but there is no way we will ever be able to match the peak demands of the system this way.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Parallax",,
IndEvo_riftgun,WEAPON,"""Work with the blackbox device has proven dangerous, to say the least. We've had multiple cases of strange rifts appearing out of thin air while the device was under power before the regulator unit was installed, and someone lost a finger to one of them. Got lucky, if you ask me. We'll attempt to fit the focusing unit tomorrow, now that our measured output levels have stabilised in a weaponisable range, and I pray we get some good results before project lead gets pissy again.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Keyhole",,
IndEvo_artillery_missile,WEAPON,"A massive, destroyer-sized missile array launching ECM torpedos that scatter drive-field disrupting chaff in a large area. These missiles are a menace to ships that rely on speed to dodge projectiles, and have caused thousands of spacers to experience a cold, slow death in the embrace of space after their drives gave out under the constant disruption. Their explosion interdicts and overloads any nearby ships.",,,
IndEvo_artillery_mortar,WEAPON,"A cannon the size of a destroyer raining destabilized antimatter onto the battlefield. Primitive or regressed societies in star systems with mortar artilleries often use iconography depicting the shining red projectiles as harbingers of death, as they have a habit of hitting planets due to the sheer amount of shells fired in a volley. The long-range munitions are more potent than the tactical armaments used in close combat, which are nonetheless lethal.",,,
IndEvo_artillery_railgun,WEAPON,"If sound could transmit in space, the whine of these immense coils might be heard on the planets they orbit. The shells of metal-turned-plasma travel at speeds unimaginable, requiring pre-ionized lanes of travel to stop them from ripping into hyperspace. Standard spacer operating protocol when encountering a railgun artillery is to engage full burn to the closest jump point - not that this has ever saved anyone.",,,

IndEvo_mine_field,TERRAIN,"A semi-autonomous, self replicating minefield. Spent mines get replaced automatically, allowing the field to persist hundreds of years without loss of efficiency.",,,
IndEvo_slowfield,TERRAIN,A field composed of charged shrapnel and strange matter particles that disrupt drive field stability and cause slowdown. Fields like this are short-lived and were commonly used by domain strategic system defence missiles as payload.,,,

#Ships,,,,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation_base,SHIP,"A massive, multi-layer tactical installation usually constructed as primary anchor for the system wide defence efforts, artillery stations are the bogeyman of any explorer in the Sector. Expansionist era structures were often equipped with decision backup units to continue operating in case of sudden human absence, which caused a sursprising amount of these stations to not only survive the collapse but actively continue ambushing and neutralizing intruders into their territory with ruthless efficiency.

Thousands of old, spider-like repair drones crawl over every surface of the structure, repairing, replacing and guarding it, guided by the central decision unit. Taking over an artillery station is not too hard once the nexus is breached, but regardless of who the machine mind belongs to, without valid Domain credentials, it will never be completely under control. The risk is often deemed woth it, as owning an artillery station means owning a star system. As long as the machine obeys.",,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation_gunModule,SHIP,"A default gun platform with a rather light defence contingent for such an important entity, as artillery stations were never really meant to operate without escorts.",,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation_hangarModule,SHIP,"Incredibly large, sophisticated and strangely advanced integrated nanoforges pump out fighter after fighter, an endless onslaught of metal disgorged from the depths of the station. The multi-legged repair drones crawling and twisting over the machinery viciously guard it, making any attempt at tampering or removal impossible without risking the life of everyone on the station.",,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation_mortarModule,SHIP,"is a shooty, pew pew",,,
IndEvo_MissileDecoModule,SHIP,"A massive, destroyer-sized missile array launching ECM torpedos that scatter drive-field disrupting chaff in a large area. These missiles are a menace to ships that rely on speed to dodge projectiles, and have caused thousands of spacers to experience a cold, slow death in the embrace of space after their drives gave out under the constant disruption.
