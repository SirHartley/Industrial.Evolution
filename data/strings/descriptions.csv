IndEvo_JumpRift,CUSTOM,"A massive rip in the fabric of space leading to hyperspace. It was created by firing the Rift Generator, moving the planet that once stood here to a different star system.",,,
IndEvo_arsenalStation,CUSTOM,"An abandoned arsenal station, built to outlast whatever weapons a long dead enemy would have brought to bear. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
IndEvo_orbitalLaboratory,CUSTOM,"An abandoned orbital laboratory. Stations like this were built to keep experimental tech away from prying eyes. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
IndEvo_Watchtower,CUSTOM,"This automated remnant of old Domain system defence transmits targetting data to nearby artillery. The encrypted target data is inaccessible to the controlling faction, and does not expose the actual position of the observed fleet.",,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation,CUSTOM,"A massive, Domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.",,,
IndEvo_Artillery_mortar,CUSTOM,"A massive, Domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.

Old safety protocols prohibit targeting of inhabited areas.",,,
IndEvo_Artillery_railgun,CUSTOM,"A massive, Domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.

The defence platform is armed with a railgun, firing multiple extremely fast projectiles at an long range.

Old safety protocols prohibit targeting of inhabited areas.",,,
IndEvo_GachaStation,CUSTOM,"The silent rings of this massive autofactory loom in front of a violent star, heat-shields blackened by stellar emissions. Pillars of machinery, almost gothic in their complicated shapes and decorations, show the reverence with which this old station was built and kept - which obviously did not save it from abandonment.",,,
IndEvo_SubspaceStation,CUSTOM,Placeholder Text - You should download all my Mods,,,
IndEvo_AnimalCenter,CUSTOM,"Animal Centers run by the Persean Conservation Initiative are one of the few examples of independent stations around faction-owned planets. Pets never go out of style, and these bustling mini-ports are testament to that.",,,
IndEvo_abandonedPetCenter,CUSTOM,"The husk of a long abandoned pet center. Although once common, they are quick to degrade and disintegrate once abandoned, and are thus surprisingly rare. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. Closer inspection may yield salvage and rare pets.",,,
IndEvo_yeetopult,CUSTOM,"Incredibly simple in construction, yet capable of propelling a fleet across space with unbelievable speed, made possible by the arcane particles generated in a Crucible.",,,
IndEvo_crucible,CUSTOM,"Prior to the development of local coronal extraction, humanity exploited the natural vacuum of space to create artificial suns on a scale that could be harnessed by conventional means. These constructs, known as Crucibles, served as both population centers and power plants, providing energy to the system-spanning mechanisms of old.
The enormous resources bound by their construction meant that few Crucibles survived the advent of hypertech.",,,

IndEvo_base_refining,CUSTOM,"A specialized version of refining that can be reconfigured to deliver higher yields for specific commodities, at the cost of other output. Smelting plants here convert ores and transplutonic ores into metals and transplutonics, respectively. Teleoperated robotics are used to handle the most dangerous tasks, usually.",The basic version of refining delivering a balanced metal to transplutonics ratio.,,
IndEvo_ore_refining,CUSTOM,"Low-tech smelting infrastructure to extract valuable metal from ore. Does not work with transplutonics or other rare ores very well, but reaches a higher basic metal extraction efficiency than normal smelting plants. This is a brutal, hot and unforgiving work environment, eating men at a rate similar to the ore it smelts.","A harsh, low-tech refinery complex with increased metal but decreased transplutonics output.",,
IndEvo_rare_refining,CUSTOM,"Specialized, high tech smelting infrastructure to extract rare transplutonics from the respective ores. Normal ore is barely smelted here as, the automated furnaces are specialized towards exotic ore applications. Teleoperated robotics handle most of the work.","A specialized high-tech refinery with increased transplutonics output, but reduced metal smelting capacity.",,
IndEvo_base_mining,CUSTOM,"Metal and metalloid ores, organics, and volatile compounds all require heavy equipment, special infrastructure, and a skilled workforce to extract. The harsh work attracts a certain type, and an administration that's not willing to look the other way now and again may find itself running short of willing personnel.","The basic version of mining, extracting all mineable resources at a similar rate.",,
IndEvo_ore_mining,CUSTOM,"Open pit mines and shafts hewn deep into the stone extract ore in a somewhat haphazard, but large scale mining operation. Auto-prospectors focus on the common metal veins, forgoing complicated trace minerals in favor of larger, less rare deposits. The work is harsh and unforgiving, much like the miners who operate the machinery.","A large-scale mining operation targeting common metal veins, forgoing complicated trace minerals.",,
IndEvo_rare_mining,CUSTOM,"A large mining operation extracting rare minerals from the earth. The specialized processes required to mine the traces and small veins available are sensitive, and often too dangerous, to run alongside the sledgehammer approach used by conventional mining. While of a higher tech-level than normal mining, the work environment still demands a certain toll.",Mining operations prioritizing trace metals and rare ore extraction using high-tech mining methods.,,
IndEvo_volatile_mining,CUSTOM,"Capturing volatiles is rather easy. Doing it with high efficiency, however, is not, and requires machinery sensitive to disruptions - making large mining or fracking operations almost impossible. The additional output these high-tech onsite refineries provide is usually deemed worth it, even if they operate on human capital as much as any other resource extraction operation.",A volatile extraction operation using extremely delicate machinery for capture and high efficiency on-site refining.,,
IndEvo_organics_mining,CUSTOM,"Pump-anchor phasing, relativistic borehole creation, strange matter liquid displacement and other disruptive exploitation techniques used to get at deep organic depots are extremely lucrative and efficient, but they make other extraction operations almost impossible due to the sheer impact they have on the environment and the manpower required to run them. Working this job is not very pleasant and attracts a certain clientele that others like to avoid.","High volume, super-deep organics wells to get at even the most remote deposits, forgoing other extractables.",,
IndEvo_pop_default,CUSTOM,"The basic infrastructure required to support a given population, from rickety orbital hab-modules to megacities and everything between.","This is the default governing style, encouraging slow growth, stability and a regulated economic profile.",,
IndEvo_pop_uw,CUSTOM,"A cartel of ruthless criminal families rule this polity with an iron fist. Petty decisions are made by the local bosses on a whim, and individual fortune can change quicker than credsticks change hands in one of the countless gambling dens. Everything can be made possible by the ever-changing status quo - everything, except personal safety.","Places a criminal cartel in power of this planet, decreasing income at high stability, and increasing it at low stability. Collects voluntary donations from traders visiting the system.",,
IndEvo_pop_rural,CUSTOM,"The people of this polity live in small, distributed villages instead of central cities. Most commodities are locally sourced, if only out of necessity and the lacking infrastructure. Life is much simpler and less convenient than on planets with equivalent population numbers, yet preferred by many due to the general state of the sector. Disturbing this environment with dirty industry will cause severe protests.","Create distributed villages instead of cities, increasing population growth and stability. Farming provides drugs and organics while light industry provides supplies and weapons - and both have increased output. Industrial buildings have increased upkeep and reduce stability, rural buildings increase it instead. Using industry items or AI cores causes instability.",,
IndEvo_pop_hidden,CUSTOM,"Burrowed deep below the surface lies a massive network of connected subterranean hubs, housing the majority of the population and industry of this planet. The problems usually associated with atmospheric exposure are not present here, the cities protected by rock or water. Few people wish to stay in an environment as artificial as this, deprived of their chance to gaze at distant suns and living out their lives in damp, dark, safety.","Build a sub-surface arcology to house the population. Negates most surface hazard conditions, increases the defensive capabilities, lower growth and accessibility, and reduces industry output due to the constricted space.",,
IndEvo_pop_monks,CUSTOM,"Monastery-cities dot the mountains and plains of this planet, each ruled by a sect with unique alignment and values, in turn creating a shifting political landscape usually seen only with underdeveloped societies. The people living here are hardy, tend to have combat experience, quickly adapt to change and are strict in their values and belief - making them ideal marines.","Establish monastic sects to govern the population. Halves positive income and military building upkeep, and prevents any Luddic Path activity. The stability of this planet can not fall below 3 or exceed 7, the maximum population is limited at size 5, and marines gain experience while stationed here. The many sects sometimes provide free ships as tithes.",,
IndEvo_pop_resort,CUSTOM,"Beautiful beaches and grand hotels stretch along the shores of the the planet, while extensive recreational facilities dot the interior of the continent. This is not a place to live, but to experience, offering activities and locations for almost every price range. Industry is extremely limited to keep the environment clean and desirable, and housing is prohibitively expensive.","Declare this planet a global resort. This will massively increase the flat base income, reduce all ongoing costs by 80%, and increase the growth and stability of other planets in the system. However, a resort planet can not grow past size 4, does not support industrial buildings, and only has one industry slot.",,
IndEvo_pop_corpos,CUSTOM,"Massive neon-lit corporate arcologies tower over the slums of the more fortunate, for anyone living under corporate contractorship is considered no better than a slave. Management lives in glitz and glamour, hovercars shooting over gray worker districts as if to remind of what is possible if only you put in enough work. There is no better place to earn money than here - and no better place to lose everything you once stood for.","Leave the governance of this planet to local megacorps. This causes stability to depend on income - the more income, the higher the stability. It also increases earnings, limits the time a building can be disrupted, and unlocks all industry slots. However, military installations have massively increased costs, the working conditions cause negative base growth, and the colony can shrink in size. ",,
IndEvo_pop_helldivers,CUSTOM,"All shall prosper under the vigilant oversight of the Super-Administrator, chosen through the carefully guided will of the citizens. The populace is organized into suburbia-states, cultural trends are carefully curated, bureaucratic processes are robust, and a mandatory military service of six cycles ensures enduring stability, safety, and citizen happiness, both now and for generations to come.","Appoint a Super-Administrator to this planet. Reduces positive income and military building upkeep, and prevents any Luddic Path activity. The stability of this planet can not fall below 3 or exceed 7. The maximum population is limited to size 5, and marines gain experience while stationed here. Destroyers in storage are refitted with a hullmod that increases raid effectiveness but increases losses. Income can be increased through military actions.",,
IndEvo_pop_warhammer,CUSTOM,"Fire and metal flows through the veins of the massive hive-cities towering over refineries the size of countries. The people here move with the rhythm of towering hammers shaping metal and dreams as they flow alongside hissing pipes, shuffle towards factories, labour to cast, assemble, and unleash the arcane machines that roam the stars - by the artificers will, the forges shall never run cold.","Install an artificer cabal to govern the city-hives of this planet. As long as the commodity demands are filled industrial buildings will ignore the hazard rating. Ship hull exports will provide flat income and provide increased production budget per unit, and you will occasionally be provided with experimental ships. Beware - no crops shall grow on this world, nothing rural shall prosper, and shortages in supply will cause riots.",,
IndEvo_pop_outpost,CUSTOM,"Simple architecture and pre-fabricated hab-modules dominate the main concourse of this sparsely populated outpost. Immigration is closed, making growth impossible but allowing for use of non-scalable, civilian-grade infrastructure, which is far easier to maintain than the normal equivalent. Shuttles come and go, ferrying workers to where they need to be, never staying longer than they have to.","An Anchorage can not grow and has no industrial capacities, but comes with lower overall upkeep requirements. Anchorages can be changed to a different government type at any point.",,

#Commodities,,,,,
IndEvo_parts,RESOURCE,"Old starship parts which can no longer be properly produced by the decaying Sector infrastructure. Their only reliable source is the deconstruction of existing ships. A shortage of these will not prohibit the construction of new ships by much, but it will seriously affect their quality.",,,
IndEvo_rare_parts,RESOURCE,"Ancient or highly advanced technology which can no longer be manufactured in the Persean Sector. These components are essential to building new, pristine spaceships - they do not get traded on the open market, and are the reason Salvage Yards are usually viciously guarded.",,,
IndEvo_pet_food,RESOURCE,"Common pet food of many different kinds - from processed synth-meats, grains, and fruit, to specialized alloys for exotic specimens. Having it on board is not a necessity since it can usually be replaced with other commodities, but the convenience of having a one-size-fits-all solution is often worth it.",,,

#Weapons,,,,,
IndEvo_cryoartillery,WEAPON,"""We were able to replicate the weapon's core from a molecular scan and it appears to be functional, though we remain clueless as to how it actually operates. While it might well violently implode at any moment, we managed to hook it up to a pair of accelerator rails for now, and initial tests show it to be working at just above 2/3 of the originals measured output.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Snowblind",,
IndEvo_degrader,WEAPON,"""While the weapon has proven functional, the actual performance fell well below anticipated levels. For some reason it refuses to draw sufficient power before discharge and the project lead decided to leave it at that after one of the techs got disintegrated trying to find the cause. The new plan is to scale down the frame to just what is needed to hit the apparent draw cap.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Spitfire",,
IndEvo_causalitygun,WEAPON,"""So, the cascading energy fluctuations that have been plaguing us all week appear to have fixed themselves without our intervention. The power supply guys said they had planned to make some adjustments later today, so it wasn't them either. With how little we know about the components we're working with, it wouldn't surprise me if it's just some weird moon phases.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Eureka",,
IndEvo_pulsedcarbine,WEAPON,"""Considering the catastrophic side effects of capacitor charge processes near the core unit, we have decided to shift to an entirely different system of simply supplying new capacitor units to the weapon with ammo feeders. This seems to avert the issues entirely so far, but there is no way we will ever be able to match the peak demands of the system this way.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Parallax",,
IndEvo_riftgun,WEAPON,"""Work with the black-box device has proven dangerous, to say the least. We've had multiple cases of strange rifts appearing out of thin air while the device was under power before the regulator unit was installed, and someone lost a finger to one of them. Got lucky, if you ask me. We'll attempt to fit the focusing unit tomorrow, now that our measured output levels have stabilised in a weaponisable range, and I pray we get some good results before project lead starts asking questions again.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Keyhole",,
IndEvo_artillery_missile,WEAPON,"A massive, destroyer-sized missile array launching ECM torpedoes that scatter drive-field disrupting chaff in a large area. These missiles are a menace to ships that rely on speed to dodge projectiles, and have caused thousands of spacers to experience a cold, slow death in the embrace of space after their drives gave out under the constant disruption. Their explosion interdicts and overloads any nearby ships.",,,
IndEvo_artillery_mortar,WEAPON,"A cannon the size of a destroyer raining destabilized antimatter onto the battlefield. Primitive or regressed societies in star systems with mortar artilleries often use iconography depicting the shining red projectiles as harbingers of death, as they have a habit of hitting planets due to the sheer amount of shells fired in a volley. The long-range munitions are more potent than the tactical armaments used in close combat, which are nonetheless lethal.",,,
IndEvo_artillery_railgun,WEAPON,"If sound could transmit in space, the whine of these immense coils might be heard on the planets they orbit. The shells of metal-turned-plasma travel at speeds unimaginable, requiring pre-ionized lanes of travel to stop them from ripping into hyperspace. Standard spacer operating protocol when encountering a railgun artillery is to engage full burn to the closest jump point - not that this has ever saved anyone.",,,
hartpulse,WEAPON,"""The incessant whining about the visual aspects of the autopulse laser motivated me to redesign it from the ground up while keeping performance the same. Naming it after the guy that wouldn't shut up about its looks may have been a mistake, though.""","- Pyro Phage, Galatian Academy Intern",,

#Terrain,,,,,
IndEvo_mine_belt,TERRAIN,"A semi-autonomous, self replicating minefield, distributed in a resource-rich asteroid belt. Spent mines get replaced automatically, allowing the field to persist hundreds of years without loss of efficiency.",,,
IndEvo_mine_field,TERRAIN,"A semi-autonomous, self replicating minefield. Spent mines get replaced automatically, allowing the field to persist hundreds of years without loss of efficiency.",,,
IndEvo_slowfield,TERRAIN,A field composed of charged shrapnel and strange matter particles that disrupt drive field stability and cause slowdown. Fields like this are short-lived and were commonly used by Domain strategic system defence missiles as payload.,,,
IndEvo_SmokeCloud,TERRAIN,"A dense cloud made of sensor-impairing chaff. Clouds like this tend to disperse quickly as the residual force of their creation pushes them apart, but are still useful for hiding or as a makeshift obstacle.",,,
,,,,,
#Ships,,,,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation_base,SHIP,"A massive, multi-layer tactical installation usually constructed as primary anchor for the system wide defence efforts, artillery stations are the bogeyman of any explorer in the Sector. Expansionist era structures were often equipped with decision backup units to continue operating in case of sudden human absence, which caused a surprising amount of these stations to not only survive the collapse but actively continue ambushing and neutralizing intruders into their territory with ruthless efficiency.

Thousands of old, spider-like repair drones crawl over every surface of the structure, repairing, replacing and guarding it, guided by the central decision unit. Taking over an artillery station is not too hard once the nexus is breached, but regardless of who the machine mind belongs to, without valid Domain credentials, it will never be completely under control. The risk is often deemed worth it, as owning an artillery station means owning a star system. As long as the machine obeys.",,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation_gunModule,SHIP,"A default gun platform with a rather light defence contingent for such an important entity, as artillery stations were never really meant to operate without escorts.",,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation_hangarModule,SHIP,"Incredibly large, sophisticated and strangely advanced integrated nanoforges pump out fighter after fighter, an endless onslaught of metal disgorged from the depths of the station. The multi-legged repair drones crawling and twisting over the machinery viciously guard it, making any attempt at tampering or removal impossible without risking the life of everyone on the station.",,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation_mortarModule,SHIP,"is a shooty, pew pew",,,
IndEvo_MissileDecoModule,SHIP,"A massive, destroyer-sized missile array launching ECM torpedoes that scatter drive-field disrupting chaff in a large area. These missiles are a menace to ships that rely on speed to dodge projectiles, and have caused thousands of spacers to experience a cold, slow death in the embrace of space after their drives gave out under the constant disruption. Their explosion interdicts and overloads any nearby ships.",,,
IndEvo_MortarDecoModule,SHIP,"A cannon the size of a destroyer raining destabilized antimatter onto the battlefield. Primitive or regressed societies in star systems with mortar artilleries often use iconography depicting the shining red projectiles as harbingers of death, as they have a habit of hitting planets due to the sheer amount of shells fired in a volley. The long-range munitions are more potent than the tactical armaments used in close combat, which are nonetheless lethal.",,,
